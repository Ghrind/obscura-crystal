## Things I like in a game

* Growing power
* New challenges & known challenges
* Cybernetic upgrades
* Random weapons
* Headshots
* Different combat styles (preferably hand-to-hand or devastating/dark magic)
* Imagining my own reason for the avatar to play the game
* Designing a "camp" or a "base"
* Having the ability to craft items that suits my needs
* Having the ability to research new technologies
* Grim settings
* Growing a character from start

## Things I dislike in a game

* When difficulty is too high
* Losing without understanding why
* Having to repeat the same (boring) story arc with every new game
* Puzzles and labyrinths
* Having to look outside of the game for an answer
* Having to grind without knowing when it will end (ex: when looking for a particular piece of gear)
* Having too many possibilities, without knowing where it will lead

## Ideas / Specs

* A single character from the start, but it can have more companions in order to form a team
* The available upgrades are generated randomly for every game
* The goal of the game is to become a legend by beating a certain amount of challenges
* The challenges and where they take place are generated randomly
* The player can research new technologies
* The player can buy cybernetic upgrades for the character
